# GoPro RPY

A proof-of-concept to use gopro-telemetry to automatically adjust roll, pitch, and yaw in processed equirectangular videos/

Read this post for a bit more information about our thought processes in building this: https://www.trekview.org/blog/2022/calculating-heading-of-gopro-video-using-gpmf-part-1/

## Prerequisites

1. First extract the telemetry file (as json) from your GoPro video using [gopro-telemetry](https://github.com/JuanIrache/gopro-telemetry/). [Detailed instructions about how to do this can be found in this post](https://www.trekview.org/blog/2022/gopro-telemetry-exporter-getting-started/).
2. Install required packages `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

add arguments in command line

```shell
python3 main.py [.json file name/ file path] [--video_input video file path] [--plot True] [--mode roll,pitch,yaw]
```

`--video_input` argument is optional, a video file path to process. To be used along with --mode option.

`--plot` argument is optional, only put some value when plots are required.

`--mode` argument is optional, a comma-seperated mode to adjust roll, pitch, or yaw. Defaults to yaw.

### Example usage

#### 1. To just update the .json file with new data

```shell
python3 main.py	docs/GS010013-worldlock.json
```

#### 2. To update the .json file with new data and create plots of the roll pitch yaw and magnetic heading 

```shell
python3 main.py docs/GS010013-worldlock.json --plot true
```

#### 3. To adjust yaw of video processed with World Lock mode = true to original of a 360 video

```shell
python3 main.py docs/GS010013-worldlock.json --video_input GS010013-worldlock.mp4 --mode unworldlock
```

#### 4. To automatically level the horizon using roll of a 360 video

```shell
python3 main.py docs/GS010011-roll.json --video_input GS010011.mp4 --mode level_roll
```

#### 5. To automatically level the horizon using roll of a 360 video

```shell
python3 main.py docs/GS010010-pitch.json --video_input GS010010.mp4 --mode pitch
```

3. To adjust yaw of worldlocked 360 video. 

```shell
python3 main.py	GS010013-worldlock.json --video_input GS010011-worldlock.mp4 --mode yaw
```

4. To level horizon using roll on 360 video. 

```shell
python3 main.py	GS010011-roll.json --video_input GS010011.mp4 --mode roll
```

5. To level horizon using pitch on 360 video. 

```shell
python3 main.py	GS010010-pitch.json --video_input GS010010.mp4 --mode pitch
```

## Camera support

This script has been tested and confirmed working for:

* GoPro MAX running firmware: H19.03.02.00.00 (shows on camera LCD as 02.00)

## How it works

### 1. Calculating yaw, pitch and roll values

Camera orientation `CORI` is a relative measurement (the orientation relative to the orientation the sensor had when the acquisition started). It is reported in Quaternions in the order `w`,`x`,`y`,`z` in gopro-telemetry.

```json
"CORI":{
  "samples":[{
    "value":[0.9989318521683401,-0.024964140751365705,0.02621539963988159,0.029206213568529312],
    "cts":176.62,
    "date":"2022-05-26T08:35:42.485Z",
    "sticky":{
      "VPTS":1261037}
    },
```

To calculate yaw, pitch and roll values from this data we take the four Quarternation values (Euler Parameters) and convert them into Euler angles on each axis.

The equations to do this are somewhat complex, as you'll see from a cursory scan of this Wikipedia article; [Conversion between Quaternions and Euler angles](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_quaternions_and_Euler_angles), or by examining the code in `main.py`.

### 2. Calculating heading values

Values from the Magnetometer are reported in the axis order `z`,`x`,`y` in MicroTeslas in gopro-telemetry. 

```json
"MAGN":{
	"samples":[{
		"value":[-4,88,27],
		"cts":163.461,
		"date":"2022-05-26T08:35:42.485Z"
	},
```

To calculate heading values we first sync `MAGN` samples with their closest `CORI` sample.

Once the times have been synced and each `MAGN` sample has a corresponding `CORI` sample we can calculate the magnetic heading using the formula:

```
Mx = mx * cos(p) + my * sin(p)
My = mx * cos(r) * sin(p) + my * cos(r) + mz * sin(r) * cos (p)
M_yaw = atan2(My,Mx)
```

Where:

* `mx` = magnetometer x reading
* `my` = magnetometer y reading
* `mz` = magnetometer z reading
* `r` = roll angle
* `p` = pitch angle

_Be careful not to confuse `My` and `my` / `Mx` and `mx` (they are different variables). For clarity; `my` is the magnetic component in y direction, `My` is the output of the second equation which is approximately corrected y component of the magnetic field. The same explanation applies for `Mx` and `mx`._

### 3. Writing new values to gopro-telemetry

This script then writes out a new telemetry file (`INPUT-calculated.json`) with the following values:

* `RPYR`:
	* name: roll, pitch, yaw (x,y,z)
	* units: radians
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
* `RPYD`
	* name: roll, pitch, yaw (x,y,z)
	* units: degrees
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
* `HEAR`
	* name: magnetic heading
	* units: radians
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
* `HEAD`
	* name: magnetic heading
	* units: degrees
	* cts: milliseconds since video start
	* date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ

#### Notes on calculated data

For reference, here's a sample of the first and last `HEAD` entry in a telemetry file to demo the structure of the object;

```json
"HEAD": {
	"samples": [
		{
			"value": 2.4325704405863235,
			"cts": 189.758,
			"date": "2022-06-08T11:46:54.225Z"
		},
```

...


```json
		{
			"value": -1.9311572331906321,
			"cts": 21121.995333333347,
			"date": "2022-06-08T11:47:15.591Z"
		}
	],
	"name": "magnetic heading",
	"units": "degrees"
	}
},
```

### 4. Use to level / adjust video

This proof of concept was developer with 3 use-cases in mind

#### 4.1 Adjustment for World Lock (`--unworldlock`)

World Lock fixes the heading of the video (so the video always faces the same compass heading).

One aim was to reverse the World Lock setting and show video using the true heading of the cameras front lens.

To do this, we assume the first `HEAD` value to be the World Lock heading (aka the heading all the frames are fixed to).

Then all that's required is to subtract the World Lock heading from the true compass heading (reported in the telemetry) to get the yaw off-set for the frame and use-open CV to modify the frame appropriately ([although executed differently, the logic to do this is described in detail here](https://www.trekview.org/blog/2022/adjusting-yaw-equirectangular-images/))

##### 4.1.1 Example

Video input:

[![GS010013-worldlock](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3Hces_LyGZU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3Hces_LyGZU)

```shell
python3 main.py docs/GS010013-worldlock.json --plot true --video_input GS010013-worldlock.mp4 --mode unworldlock
```

Output:

![RPY GS010013-worldlock.mp4](/docs/GS010013-worldlock-RPY.png)

![Magnetic heading GS010013-worldlock.mp4](/docs/GS010013-worldlock-heading.png)

##### 4.1.2 Note on adjusting Yaw in non-World Lock Videos

Let's say your camera is mounted to a monopod and is a few degrees in the wrong direction (perhaps your helmet mount isn't perfectly straight). In this case you can use a fixed offset in ffmpeg (no need for this script) to the frames using the `v360` filter. Here is an example adjusting yaw by 3 degrees):

```shell
ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -vf v360=e:e:yaw=3 OUTPUT.mp4
```

#### 4.2 Auto level roll (`--level_roll`)

Roll in video can cause the horizon to sway from side to side. By leveling roll, you can keep the horizon level.

To do this, we assume yaw (x) = `0` to be level. Any frames where `x` does not equal `0` means the camera is rolling.

All that's then needed is to take the difference between the roll reported in the telemetry and 0 to get the roll offset for the frame and use ffmpeg to adjust accordingly.

#### 4.3 Auto level pitch (`--level_pitch`)

This one was more for fun. We didn't really have a true use-case for it, but wanted to 

Similar to roll, we assume pitch (y) = `0` to be level. Any frames where `y` does not equal `0` means the camera is pitching.

All that's then needed is to take the difference between the pitch reported in the telemetry and 0 to get the pitch offset for the frame and use ffmpeg to adjust accordingly.
